### Pysolation
A python implementation of the game Isolation. Users take turns moving their character, then removing a tile from the board. As the board shrinks, movement becomes limited until eventually a player is unable to move and therefore loses.
The game defaults to running in the browser, but can also be played through the command-line. Directly running main.py will launch the game with 2 players, and 1 AI player. Game will be at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ where you can begin playing immediately with a friend sitting beside you.
